    Of course we need to put some fun things here in the HTML comments for those of you that are looking for
    them. Our course uses characters from the iconic, US movie from the 1980s, The Princess Bride.

    Everyone who has watched the movie knows about Inigo Montoya, Dread Pirate Roberts, and Princess Buttercup.
    But few people know the name of the person that was the 'negative cutter' on that movie. Tweet who that was
    to #SEC487 and I'll know that you read these comments.

    Thanks for stopping by the site and I hope to see you, or to have seen you, in the SEC487 class!
